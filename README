Enhanced C defintions 
https://github.com/vim-scripts/aftersyntaxc.vim
    Incorporates and improves upon some of the changes added in vimscript #1201. 
    This improved .cvim identifies operators, delimiters, and user-defined 
    functions/function calls. Also included is a wealth of standard ANSI C 
    function names as keywords. The Match regexps for user-defined functions 
    have been improved.
